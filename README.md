# Data Analyst Project: SQL Queries and Data Transfer for Marketing Targeting

## Project Overview
This project leverages SQL to extract and analyze data to help identify key customer segments for targeted marketing. By diving deep into the data, we can provide valuable insights to refine marketing strategies.

## Objectives
- Extract relevant data using SQL
- Analyze and categorize data for targeted marketing
- Provide actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies

## Data Source
The original dataset has been uploaded to this GitHub repository for reference.

## SQL Queries
The SQL queries used in this project are available in the `Sales Data Marketing.sql` file.

## Results and Insights
We segmented the data into four categories based on salary for a more detailed analysis. Key insights include:
- Identifying customer segments based on spending patterns in relation to variables like age group, gender, salary range, marital status, home ownership, and number of children.
- Creating a dashboard to visualize these segments, which can greatly aid in identifying target demographics for the marketing team.

These insights are designed to help the marketing team better allocate their budget and predict the return on investment (ROI) for marketing campaigns.

## Conclusion
The findings from this project can significantly shape the company's future marketing efforts, leading to more effective and efficient marketing strategies.

## How to Use
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Download the dataset and the `Sales Data Marketing.sql` file.
2. Run the SQL queries to extract and manipulate the data.
